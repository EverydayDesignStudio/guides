# Setting up a Raspberry Pi ðŸ¥§

### Quick Overview
You can use a Raspberry Pi (RPi for short) basically like any other desktop computer. The first time you boot the RPi, you will need to install an OS, which is all explained pretty comprehensively on the RPi website (linked below). Most recent projects in EDS, have used [`Raspbian`](https://www.raspbian.org).
If you connect a display, a keyboard and a mouse to the RPi, it practically is a desktop computer (albeit a little slower than todayâ€™s standard).

### SD Card
Note that the operating system is run off of the micro SD card. Hence the read/write speeds are crutial. Tal and Jordan found [this comparison](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/raspberry-pi-microsd-card-performance-comparison-2018) helpful when deciding which card to buy. <br>
Recommended SD Card: [`Samsung 64GB EVO Plus`](https://www.amazon.ca/Samsung-Class-Adapter-MB-MC64DA-AM/dp/B01273JZMG/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1549166261&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=samsung+evo+plus+64gb&psc=1)

### OS Installation

If you already know how to do this and just need the link: [`NOOBS`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/)


### Finding RPi IP Address
On the RPi find the IP address by opening up a terminal and typing: `ping raspberrypi` <br> 
If the IP were ever to change, you can always find it using this method.

### Controlling over SSH
You can run the RPi in what is called a â€˜headlessâ€™ mode. This means no screen, no keyboard and mouse or other conventional control peripherals. In order to control the RPi in this manner, you can connect to it over SSH. Most RPis the studio is using has an onboard WiFi antenna and is capable of connecting to the studioâ€™s wireless network. 

1. In order to connect to the RPi over SSH you first need to make sure _your laptop_ and the _RPI_ is connected to the same wireless network: `eds5g` password: `DesignStudio2016`.

2. Back on your laptop open up a Linux terminal and type the following command and hit enter: <br>
`ssh pi@192.168.0.101` (where _192.168.0.101_ is the IP address of your specific RPi). If you don't know your RPi's IP, [see above](#finding-rpi-ip-address).

3. If the RPi is on and has an active internet connection, you should see the following response:
`pi@192.168.0.101's password:`

4. You can then type the password to user â€˜piâ€™ on the RPi and confirm with Enter.

Once your in, you can navigate the RPi just like you would any Linux machine, using `ls`, `cd`, `touch`, `mkdir`, etc.

In case you are setting up a new RPi and running it in headless mode, [this website](https://howtoraspberrypi.com/how-to-raspberry-pi-headless-setup/) does a good job of explaining how you make a RPi connect to a WiFi network without ever requiring so much as a mouse or keyboard for the RPi itself. Handy if youâ€™re working on a laptop and have no external keyboard/mouse or display available.

### Connecting over VNC
The RPi also has VNC software installed. In case you require the desktop environment of the RPi, but can't connect a display to it, you can use your own VNC software to connect to the RPi.

1. On your laptop, download [`VNC Viewer`](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/). Note that unless you will need to be streaming your desktop, you just need VNC Viewer, not VNC Server. Also note that the titles on the VNC website make it confusing as to which program you're downloading.

2. On the RPI open VNC server to _broadcast_ your RPi's desktop over the network.

3. On your laptop, VNC Viewer, enter the IP address of the RPi. This is like selecting a particular chanel on a TV. If you don't know your RPi's IP, [see above](#finding-rpi-ip-address)

4. It should connect and you will be able to see the desktop of the RPi on your laptop.

### Programs to Install
Here's a few recommended programs to remember to install
| Program| Link / Code|
|--------|------------|
|Processing | https://pi.processing.org|
|Vim | `sudo apt-get install vim`|

### Programming for the RPi
>In the past Iâ€™ve edited code on the RPi (i.e. not headless, but while connecting the RPi to a display, keyboard and mouse). This is also possible, but the code editor on the RPi does not come close to the code editor youâ€™re using on your laptop in terms of ease of use. Besides, the RPi is a somewhat slow computer, so typing can lag behind. - Tal Amram
